1. Precision: The fraction of detections reported by the model that were correct.
2. Recall: The fraction of true events that were detected.
3. F-score: 2pr/(p + r).
4. Sometime add a small fraction of the total number of example will not have a noticeable impact on generalization error. It is therefore recommended to experiment with training set sizes on a logarithmic scale.
