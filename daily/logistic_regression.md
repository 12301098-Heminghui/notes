### 5 [One- and itwo-tailed testes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-_and_two-tailed_tests)
1. a one-tailed test and a two-tailed test are alternative ways of computing the statistical significance of a parameter inferred from a data set.
2. One-tailed tests are used for asymmetric distributions that have a single tail, such as the chi-squared distribution, which are common in measuring goodness-of-fit, or for one side of a distribution that has two tails, such as the normal distribution, which is common in estimating location; this corresponds to specifying a direction.
