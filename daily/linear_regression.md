# linear regression
### 1. [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)
1. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the **conditional probability distribution** of y given X, rather than on the **joint probability distribution** of y and X, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.
2. In statistics and numerical analysis, the problem of numerical methods for **linear least squares** is an important one because linear regression models are one of the most important types of model, both as formal statistical models and for exploration of data sets.
