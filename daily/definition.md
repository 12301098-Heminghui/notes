1. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories, are called **classification** problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called **regression**.
2. The goal in such **unsupervised learning** problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called **clustering**, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as **density estimation**, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of **visualization**.
3.  Finally, the technique of **reinforcement learning** (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is con- cerned with the problem of finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to **maximize a reward**. A general feature of reinforcement learning is the trade-off between **exploration**, in which the system tries out new kinds of actions to see how effective they are, and **exploitation**, in which the system makes use of actions that are known to yield a high reward.
