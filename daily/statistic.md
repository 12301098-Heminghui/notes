1. **likelihood function** for the bayesian regression: **p(D|w)**.
2. In both the **Bayesian** and **frequentist paradigms**, the likelihood function p(D|w) plays a central role. However, the manner in which it is used is fundamentally dif- ferent in the two approaches. In a frequentist setting, w is considered to be a fixed parameter, whose value is determined by some form of ‘estimator’, and error bars on this estimate are obtained by considering the distribution of possible data sets D. By contrast, from the Bayesian viewpoint there is only a single data set D (namely the one that is actually observed), and the uncertainty in the parameters is expressed through a probability distribution over w.
