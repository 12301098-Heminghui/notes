### Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks (zfnet)
1. Show why cnn perform so well and how to improve it.
2. introduce a visualization technique that reveal the input stimuli that excit individual feature map at any layer in the model.
3. observe the evolution of feature during training and diagnose potential problem with the model. 
4. multi-layer deconvolution network: project the feature activations back to the input pixel space.
