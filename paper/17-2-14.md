### ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (AlexNet)
1. top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.j0%
2. 60 million parameters and 650000 neurons
3. Five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers.
4. three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax
5. non-saturating neuraons
6. a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution
7. Using dropout
8. using ReLU nonlinearity is faster to training
9. Faster learning has a great influence on the performance of large models trained on large datasets.
10. Dropout roughly doubles the number of iterations required to converge
11. momentum and weight decay
